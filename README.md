# AE Technical Project

See [README](https://github.com/heather-p/ae_technical_project/blob/main/dbt_project/README.md) in `dbt_project` folder for writeup.

All of the [models](https://github.com/heather-p/ae_technical_project/tree/main/dbt_project/models) relevant to the technical project are in `dbt_project` > `models` > `source`. The `seeds` folder just has the sample data loaded in.

I did add a `stage` folder as well, but ran out of time to flesh out a stage model.

I kept the technical project content in [one commit](https://github.com/heather-p/ae_technical_project/commit/35cc60066482e2fb63cea06d4673ab9420443f24), separate from the dbt project initialization commit, to help reduce noise.
